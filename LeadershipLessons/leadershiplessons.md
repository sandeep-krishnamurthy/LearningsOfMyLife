1. Donot simplify the problem for high achievers. You loose them. Good people always expect challenges, ambiguity, risks and ownership attached to the tasks they do. Never assume that as a leader you are doing great job by disambiguiting, simplifying and make the job easy for your team. You are insulting and demotivating by simplifying the problems!

2. A good leader is a good listener. Never break in between when your team members are putting up their point. You are at risk of missing out an interesting idea and also one step forward in killing an innovation and leader from bein born in your team. 
But, never be in situation where you don't have your opinions and suggestions. Your team is looking up to you as a leader with opinion and vision.

3. Lead from the front, be hands-on. High achievers love to work for another high achiever. You cannot influence and prepare an army of leaders with just a great looking Excel sheet! Be like Elon Musk :-)

4. Focus, focus and focus. Great leaders always have strong focus towards a vision. They relentlessly try to align every task they do and lead towards that one grand vision. Leaders will never spread thin and lose focus.
