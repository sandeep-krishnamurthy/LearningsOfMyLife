# Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft's Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone
## - Satya Nadella, Greg Shaw, Jill Tracie Nichols, and Bill Gates

## My Notes
1. As the title of this book implies, he didn’t completely break with the past—when you hit refresh on your 
browser, some of what’s on the page stays the same. 
2. democratizing leading-edge computer technology. 
3. Fear: of being ridiculed; of failing; of not looking like the smartest person in the room. And arrogance: I am too 
important for these games. “What a stupid question,” we had grown used to hearing. 
4. Ideas excite me. Empathy grounds and centers me. 
5. If you could understand impermanence deeply, you would develop more equanimity. 
6. Each leader was no longer solely employed by Microsoft, they had tapped into a higher calling—to employ Microsoft in
 pursuit of their personal passions to empower others. 
7. First, as prologue, I’ll share my own transformation moving from India to my new home in America with stops in the 
heartland, in Silicon Valley, and at a Microsoft then in its ascendancy. Part two focuses on hitting refresh at Microsoft as the unlikely CEO who succeeded Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. Microsoft’s transformation under my leadership is not complete, but I am proud of our progress. In the third and final act, I’ll take up the argument that a Fourth Industrial Revolution lies ahead, one in which machine intelligence will rival that of humans. 
8. Why does Microsoft exist? And why do I exist in this new role? These are questions everyone in every organization 
should ask themselves. 
9. She cared deeply about my being happy, confident, and living in the moment without regrets. 
10. always believed in doing your thing, and at your pace. Pace comes when you do your thing. So long as you enjoy it, 
do it 
11. mindfully and well, and have an honest purpose behind it, life won’t fail you. 
12. instilling in me the confidence not to pursue what was easy, but to tackle the biggest and hardest problems in 
computer science. 
13. MR, AI, and quantum may be independent threads today, but they are going to come together. We’re betting on it. 
14. technology company that misses multiple trends like these will inevitably fall behind. At the same time, of course, 
it’s dangerous to chase untested future technologies while neglecting the core of the current business. That’s the classic innovator’s dilemma—to risk existing success while pursuing new opportunities. 
15. To avoid being trapped by the innovator’s dilemma—and to move from always focusing on the urgency of today to 
considering the important things for tomorrow—we decided to look at our investment strategy across three growth horizons: first, grow today’s core businesses and technologies; second, incubate new ideas and products for the future; and third, invest in long-term breakthroughs. 
16. Lowe’s home improvement stores, for example, are using HoloLens to allow their customers to stand in their own 
kitchens and bathrooms, and superimpose holograms of new cabinets, appliances, and accessories so they can see exactly what their remodel will look like. 
17. BESPOKE. Today we are very much on the ground floor of AI. It is bespoke, customized. Tech companies with privileged
 access to data, computing power, and algorithms handcraft an AI product and make it available to the world. Only a few can make AI for the many. This is where most AI is today. DEMOCRATIZED. The next level is democratization. As a platform company—one that has always built foundational technologies and tools upon which others can innovate—Microsoft’s approach is to put the tools for building AI in the hands of everyone. Democratizing AI means enabling every person and every organization to dream about and create amazing AI solutions that serve their specific needs. 
18. LEARN TO LEARN. Ultimately, the state of the art is when computers learn to learn—when computers generate their own 
programs. Like humans, computers will go beyond mimicking what people do and will invent new, better solutions to problems. Deep neural networks and transfer learning are leading to breakthroughs today, but AI is like a ladder and we are just on the first step of that ladder. At the top of the ladder is artificial general intelligence and complete machine understanding of human language. 
19. figuring out the weak link of 
20. discovered which sections of HIV proteins are absolutely essential to their function so that a vaccine can be 
trained to attack those very regions. 
21. quantum computing development, the very future of our industry. Its 
22. It would take a classical computer 1 billion years to break today’s RSA-2048 encryption, but a quantum computer 
could crack it in about a hundred seconds, or less than two minutes. Fortunately, quantum computing will also revolutionize classical computing encryption, leading to ever more secure computing. 
23. get there we need three scientific and engineering breakthroughs. The math breakthrough we’re working on is a 
topological qubit. The superconducting breakthrough we need is a fabrication process to yield thousands of topological qubits that are both highly reliable and stable. The computer science breakthrough we need is new computational methods for programming the quantum computer. 
24. At Microsoft, we’re betting that quantum computing will make artificial intelligence more intelligent and mixed 
reality an even more immersive experience. 
25. Confronting North Korea could prove to be enormously costly. A lot was on the line, including our brand. But, in the
 end, we determined that something far more important was at stake: Who we are. Free speech, privacy, security, and sovereignty are timeless, nonnegotiable values. 
26. After all, our products may come and go, but our values are timeless. The 
27. their CEO Jeff Weiner turned to me and said, “Consistency over time is trust.” 
28. you’d like to glimpse the state of computer-human relations and to understand its future, a good way to start is to 
observe some of the conversations we are having with our digital counterparts. Already millions of people around the world are working and talking with digital productivity assistants like Cortana; millions more spend part of everyday interacting with social companions—chatbots—like Xiaoice in China and Zo in the United States. 
29. As this dialogue suggests, the challenge for those of us in the business of designing AI is to get not just the 
intelligence right, but also the human qualities—emotion, ethics, and empathy. 
30. When talking and chatting with other people, often you aren’t looking to complete a task, but rather to connect 
socially and develop a relationship. 
31. AI will fail if it can’t complement its IQ with EQ. 
32. Make no mistake, these are tremendous science and engineering feats. But the future holds far greater promise than 
computers beating humans at games. Ultimately, humans and machines will work together—not against one another. Imagine what’s possible when humans and machines work together to solve society’s greatest challenges—disease, ignorance, and poverty. 
33. Too many debates over the future of AI overlook the potential beauty of machines and humans working in tandem. Our 
perception of AI seems trapped somewhere between the haunting voice of the murderous rogue computer HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey and the friendlier voices of today’s personal digital assistants—Cortana, Siri, and Alexa. We can daydream about how we will use our suddenly abundant spare time when machines drive us places, handle our most mundane chores, and help us make better decisions. 
34. At our developer conferences, I explain Microsoft’s approach to AI as based on three core principles. First, we want
 to build intelligence that augments human abilities and experiences. Rather than thinking in terms of human vs. machine, we want to focus on how human gifts such as creativity, empathy, emotion, physicality, and insight can be mixed with powerful AI computation—the ability to reason over large amounts of data and do pattern recognition more quickly—to help move society forward. Second, we also have to build trust directly into our technology. We must infuse technology with protections for privacy, transparency, and security. AI devices must be designed to detect new threats and devise appropriate protections as they evolve. And third, all of the technology we build must be inclusive and respectful to everyone, serving humans across barriers of culture, race, nationality, economic status, age, gender, physical and mental ability, and more. 
35. In software development terms, AI is becoming a third run time—the next system on top of which programmers will 
build and execute applications. The PC was the first run time for which Microsoft developed applications like the Office suite of tools—Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and the rest. Today the Web is the second run time. In an AI and robotics world, productivity and communication tools will be written for an entirely new platform, one that doesn’t just manage information but also learns from information and interacts with the physical world. 
36. “After all, how we experience the world is through communications and collaboration. If we are interested in 
machines that work with us, then we can’t ignore the humanistic approach.” 
37. AI must be designed to assist humanity. Even as we build more autonomous machines, we need to respect human autonomy
. Collaborative robots (co-bots) should take on dangerous work like mining, thus creating a safety net and safeguards for human workers. AI must be transparent. All of us, not just tech experts, should be aware of how the technology works and what its rules are. We want not just intelligent machines but intelligible machines; not just artificial intelligence but symbiotic intelligence. The technology will know things about humans, but the humans must also know about how the technology sees and analyzes the world. What if your credit score is wrong but you can’t access the score? Transparency is needed when social media collects information about you but draws the wrong conclusions. Ethics and design go hand in hand. AI must maximize efficiencies without destroying the dignity of people. 
38. thinking clearly about the skills future generations must prioritize and cultivate. To stay relevant, our kids and 
their kids will need: 
39. EMPATHY—Empathy, which is so difficult to replicate in machines, will be invaluable in the human-AI world. The 
ability to perceive others’ thoughts and feelings, to collaborate and build relationships will be critical. 
40. EDUCATION—Some argue that because life spans will increase, birth rates will decline, and thus spending on education
 will decline as well. But I believe that to create and manage innovations we cannot fathom today, we will need increased investment in education to attain higher level thinking and more equitable education outcomes. 
41. CREATIVITY—One of the most coveted human skills is creativity, and this won’t change. Machines will enrich and 
augment our creativity, but the human drive to create will remain central. 
42. JUDGMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY—We may be willing to accept a computer-generated diagnosis or legal decision, but we 
will still expect a human to be ultimately accountable for the outcomes. 
43. Today we don’t think of aviation as “artificial flight”—it’s simply flight. In the same way, we shouldn’t think of 
technological intelligence as artificial, but rather as intelligence that serves to augment human capabilities and capacities. 
44. Would you prefer to have $100,000 today or be a millionaire in 1920? Many would love to be a millionaire in the 
previous century, but your money then could not buy lifesaving penicillin, a phone call to family on the other side of the country, or many of the benefits of innovations we take for granted today. 
45. Leaders were asking how the latest wave of technology could be used to grow jobs and economic opportunity. It’s the 
question I get most often from city, state, and national leaders wherever I travel. Part of my response is to urge policymakers to broaden their thinking about the role of technology in economic development. Too often they focus on trying to attract Silicon Valley companies in hopes they will open offices locally. They want Silicon Valley satellites. Instead, they should be working on plans to make the best technologies available to local entrepreneurs so that they can organically grow more jobs at home—not just in high-tech industries but in every economic sector. They need to develop economic strategies that can enhance the natural advantages their regions enjoy in particular industries by fully and quickly embracing supportive leading-edge technologies. But there is often an even bigger problem—they are uncertain about investing in the latest technology, like the cloud. The most profound difference between leaders is whether they fear or embrace new technology. It’s a difference that can determine the trajectory of a nation’s economy. 
46. Based on this analysis, Comin agrees that differences between rich and poor nations can largely be explained by the 
speed at which they adopted industrial technologies. 
47. ∑ (Education + Innovation) × Intensity of Tech Use = Economic Growth 
48. leaders need to prioritize entrepreneurship in several major ways. The first is providing broad access to Internet 
connectivity and cloud computing services to all citizens. 
49. Leaders at every level—from national to community-level—should foster not just fast but intense adoption of new 
technologies that can drive productivity. 
50. Another high-priority area is fostering human capital and next-generation skills development. Building knowledge 
allows workers to keep up with the increasing pace of technology. 
51. We also need to continue to promote free and fair trade. If we want to see growth and see it more broadly, opening 
up more markets and clearing barriers to trade for entrepreneurs is an essential step. 
52. MIT economist Daron Acemoglu visited our campus to report on his research into the effects of technology automation 
on labor. He found that new intelligent machines, particularly industrial robots, could have very consequential effects on the labor market. His estimates suggest that, on average, each additional industrial robot reduces employment by about three workers. This suggests that, without any countervailing changes, the spread of industrial robots could have very adverse consequences for jobs and wages. Nevertheless, Acemoglu argues that other powerful changes triggered by this onslaught could at least partly reverse these consequences. As machines replace labor in some tasks, firms will be incentivized to create new tasks in which humans have a comparative advantage. Acemoglu sums it up this way: “Although automation tends to reduce employment and the share of labor in national income, the creation of more complex tasks has the opposite effect.” Throughout history new classes of workers and new, more complex tasks have resulted from cutting-edge technologies. Acemoglu continues, “The creation of new complex tasks always increases wages, employment and share of labor. But when automation runs ahead of the process of creation of new, labor-intensive tasks, technological change will bring lower employment.” We need a balanced growth path. We need to invent a new social contract for this age of AI and automation that fosters the equilibrium between individual labor—one’s agency, wages, sense of purpose, and fulfillment—and the return on capital. 
53. “No matter what city you live in, no matter what business or industry you work for, no matter what kind of work you 
do—when it comes to your career, right now, you may be heading down the same path as Detroit.” What we aspire to do through LinkedIn is to build a network of alliances to help provide the intelligence on opportunities, training resources, and collective action we all can take to create economic opportunity for individuals. 
54. do have a bias for which I am unapologetic. It is a bias for driving investment toward technological advancements in
 services like LinkedIn and Office that help people create, connect, and become more productive rather than software that is simply entertaining—memes for conspicuous consumption. Spillover effects on the economy are pretty limited for technologies that don’t foster a more equitable ratio of consumption to creation. Nonetheless, Wall Street has put a lot of value recently on these consumption technologies. 
55. “Entrepreneurs contribute to economic growth far more than the narrow word ‘innovation’ can convey,” he writes. And 
education, he further notes, is innovation’s closest cousin in fueling growth. 
56. It’s important to be dedicated to creating great products, serving customers, and earning profits for our 
investors—but it’s not sufficient. We also need to think about the impact of our actions on the world and its citizens long into the future. 
57. Why do I exist?” “Why does our institution exist?” “What is the role of a multinational corporation in our world? 
“What is the role of a leader in digital technology, especially as the world turns to tech as such a crucial input to drive growth?” These questions haunt me, and they motivated me to write Hit Refresh. Finding answers set me on an intellectual and introspective journey to discover what I uniquely can contribute to society and how to rediscover the soul of Microsoft, to define our role as a global company. 
58. They guide me daily in the pursuit to bring empathy together with big ideas in order to make a real difference. 
Hopefully the stories and lessons along the course of my journey have produced something useful to you in your own life and work. I also hope these existential questions spark conversations among policymakers, business leaders, and technologists. In an often-divided world that is careening toward ever more dramatic technological, economic, demographic, and even climatic shifts—we have to redefine the role of multinational corporations and the role of leadership. 
59. Economist Richard Baldwin, author of The Great Convergence, writes that the origin of today’s anti-globalization 
sentiment in the wealthiest nations lies in the fact that their share of world income has plummeted from 70 percent in 1990 to 46 percent in just the past two decades. In other words, wealthy nations like the United States, France, Germany, and the UK have witnessed a large drop in their share of world income. The combination of low wages and information technologies that radically lowered the cost of moving ideas has meant that places like China and India have significantly gained in the share of world income while rich nations are now back to 1914 levels, igniting anti-globalization feelings in some quarters. 
60. Baldwin predicts a third wave of globalization will come when telepresence and telerobotics (like HoloLens)—really 
good substitutes for people crossing borders to provide services—become affordable. 
61. The world used to grow at 4 percent per year, but it is now growing at roughly 2 percent. So, we need new technology
 breakthroughs in order to have the type of growth we had in the twentieth century. Mixed reality, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing are going to be game changers, creating new economic surplus, but also disrupting the workforce, eliminating the routine jobs we take for granted today. 
62. As we encounter more and more artificial intelligence, real intelligence, real empathy, and real common sense will 
be scarce. The new jobs will be predicated on knowing how to work with machines, but also on these uniquely human attributes. 
63. in CEO is about being the curator of culture. After 
64. Microsoft no longer employs people, people employ Microsoft.
