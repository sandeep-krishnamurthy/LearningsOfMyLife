# Summary
I completed reading the book - "[ELON MUSK: How the Billionaire CEO of SPACEX and TESLA is shaping our future](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233)" by Ashlee Vance. This is a fantastic book that I strongly recommend for anyone seeking how to think big, how to develop a habit of working towards a vision, stay focussed and work harder. The book greatly succeeds in spilling the beans on how hard it is to be Elon Musk. The book is very successful in depicting strong foundational leadership skillsets required for a successful technologist and businessman. Along with all these, this book brings up lot of surprising and interesting events in creation of the world's greatest companies like PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity. This book takes you through incredible journey of Elon Musk and his team's hardwork, sacrifices and smart business moves to bring these incredible companies to where they are from the jaws of bankruptcy and more troubles. This book succeeds in giving you the feel of what runs in the mind of the genius Musk and his motives behind all his work. A must read book! Kudos to Ashlee Vance for making this biography such an interesting read.

Throughout my reading of the book, I captured interesting scenarios, quotes and description by the author. Below, I summarize and reproduce the content that I myself want to read multiple times to stay focused and work towards my mission of democratizing education.

`Note:` This summary is by no way an alternate to you buying the book and reading all by yourself. This is only intended to capture and share my learnings from the books I read.

# Early Days in SouthAfrica

## Highly focussed - Block out the disturbing world
Elon's mother says - At five and six age, he had found a way to block out the world and dedicate all of his concentration to a single task.
When asked about this, Elon says - Computers split their hardest jobs between two types of chips. There are graphics chips that deal with processingthe images produced by a television show stream or video game and computational chips that handle general purpose tasks and mathematical operations. Over time, Musk ended up thinking that his brain has equivalent of a graphics chip. It allows him to see things out in the world, replicate them in his mind, and imagine how they might change or behave when interating with other objects.

## Voracious reader - Read Britannica Encyclopedia - A fact factory Musk
Elon's mother says - The most striking part of Elon's character as a young boy was his compulsion to read. From a very young age, he seemed to have a book in his hands at all times. 
His brother Kimbal says - it was not unusual for him to read ten hours a day. If it was weekend, he could go through two books in a day. The family went on numerous shopping excursions in which the family realizes mid-trip that Elon had gone missing and it was known that Elon would be in nearest bookstore somewhere near the back sitting on the floor and reading in one of his trancelike states.
Elon Musk remembers - At one point, I ran out of books to read at the school library and the neighborhood library . This may be third or fourth grade. I tried to convince the librarian to order books fo me. So then, I started to read the Encyclopaedia Britannica. That was so helpful. You don't known what you don't know. You realize there are all these things out there. In fact, read 2 sets of encyclopedia. This helped him to be fact-factory.
