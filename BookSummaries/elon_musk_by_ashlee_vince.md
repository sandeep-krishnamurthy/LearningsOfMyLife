I completed reading the book - "[ELON MUSK: How the Billionaire CEO of SPACEX and TESLA is shaping our future](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233)" by Ashlee Vance. This is a fantastic book that I strongly recommend for anyone seeking how to think big, how to develop a habit of working towards a vision, stay focussed and work harder. The book greatly succeeds in spilling the beans on how hard it is to be Elon Musk. The book is very successful in depicting strong foundational leadership skillsets required for a successful technologist and businessman.

Throughout my reading of the book, I captured interesting scenarios, quotes and description by the author. Below, I summarize and reproduce the content that I myself want to read multiple times to stay focused and work towards my mission of democratizing education.

`Note:` This summary is by no way an alternate to you buying the book and reading all by yourself. This is only intended to capture and share my learnings from the books I read.
