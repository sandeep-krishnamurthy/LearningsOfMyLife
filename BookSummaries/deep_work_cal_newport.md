# Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World
## - Cal Newport
## My Notes
1. Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive 
capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. 
2. Deep work is necessary to wring every last drop of value out of your current intellectual 
3. Deep work, though a burden to prioritize, was crucial for his goal of changing the world. 
4. Allen is joined in his rejection of computers by Peter Higgs, a theoretical physicist who performs his work in such 
disconnected isolation that journalists couldn’t find him after it was announced he had won the Nobel Prize. J.K. Rowling, on 
5. I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels
. [If I instead get interrupted a lot] what replaces it? Instead of a novel that will be around for a long time… there is a bunch of e-mail messages that I have sent out to individual persons.” 
6. This state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long periods of uninterrupted 
thinking. At 
7. Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend
 to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate. 
8. alternative—constantly sending and receiving e-mail messages like human network routers, with frequent breaks for 
quick hits of distraction. Larger efforts that would be well served by deep thinking, such as forming a new business strategy or writing an important grant application, get fragmented into distracted dashes that produce muted quality. To make matters worse for depth, there’s increasing evidence that this shift toward the shallow is not a choice that can be easily reversed. Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work. 
9. our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This 
10. If you can create something useful, its reachable audience (e.g., employers or customers) is essentially 
limitless—which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if what you’re producing is mediocre, then you’re in trouble, as it’s too easy for 
11. your audience to find a better alternative online. 
12. deep work is becoming a key currency—even if most haven’t yet recognized this reality. 
13. crucial ability for anyone looking to move ahead in a globally competitive information economy that tends to chew up
 and spit out those who aren’t earning their keep. 
14. The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it
 is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. 
15. Part 1, is to convince you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second, tackled in Part 2, is to teach you how
 to take advantage of this reality by training your brain and transforming your work habits to place deep work at the core of your professional life. 
16. a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of 
valuable output. 
17. This book is best described as an attempt to formalize and explain my attraction to depth over shallowness, and to 
detail the types of strategies that have helped me act on this attraction. 
18. As intelligent machines improve, and the gap between machine and human abilities shrinks, employers are becoming 
increasingly likely to hire “new machines” instead of “new people.” 
19. Once the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest 
suffer. 
20. “Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance.” 
21. far: Current economic thinking, as I’ve surveyed, argues that the unprecedented growth and impact of technology are 
creating a massive restructuring of our economy. In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital. 
22. How to Become a Winner in the New Economy I just identified two groups that are poised to thrive and that I claim 
are accessible: those who can work creatively with intelligent machines and those who are stars in their field. 
23. If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive. 
24. If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are. 
25. the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to 
improve performance in a specific domain.” 
26. By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in
 isolation. 
27. if you’re trying to learn a complex new skill (say, SQL database management) in a state of low concentration 
(perhaps you also have your Facebook feed open), you’re firing too many circuits simultaneously and haphazardly to isolate the group 
28. of neurons you actually want to strengthen. 
29. Within the year, he stacks his teaching into the fall semester, during which he can turn all of his attention to 
teaching well and being available to his students. (This method seems to work, as Grant is currently the highest-rated teacher at Wharton and the winner of multiple teaching awards.) By batching his teaching in the fall, Grant can then turn his attention fully to research in the spring and summer, and tackle this work with less distraction. 
30. I argue that his approach to batching helps explain this paradox. In particular, by consolidating his work into 
intense and uninterrupted pulses, he’s leveraging the following law of productivity: 
31. High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) 
32. By maximizing his intensity when he works, he maximizes the results he produces per unit of time spent working. 
33. The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors 
to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment. 
34. David Allen’s Getting Things Done task-management methodology, which is a well-respected system for intelligently 
managing competing workplace obligations. This 
35. Knowledge workers, I’m arguing, are tending toward increasingly visible busyness because they lack a better way to 
demonstrate their value. Let’s give this tendency a name. 
36. Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and 
valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an 
37. industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner. 
38. This mind-set provides another explanation for the popularity of many depth-destroying behaviors. If you send and 
answer e-mails at all hours, if you schedule and attend meetings constantly, if you weigh in on instant message systems like Hall within seconds when someone poses a new question, or if you roam your open office bouncing ideas off all whom you encounter—all of these behaviors make you seem busy 
39. in a public manner. If you’re using busyness as a proxy for productivity, then these behaviors can seem crucial for 
convincing yourself and others that you’re doing your job well. 
40. This potent mixture of job ambiguity and lack of metrics 
41. to measure the effectiveness of different strategies allows behavior that can seem ridiculous when viewed 
objectively to thrive in the increasingly bewildering psychic landscape of our daily work. 
42. Deep work should be a priority in today’s business climate. But it’s not. I’ve 
43. realities that deep work is hard and shallow work is easier, that in the absence of clear goals for your job, the 
visible busyness that surrounds shallow work becomes self-preserving, and that our culture has developed a belief that if a behavior relates to “the Internet,” then 
44. the ultimate goal of this book: to systematically develop your personal ability to go deep—and by doing so, reap 
great rewards. 
45. goal of this chapter is to convince you that deep work can generate as much satisfaction in an information economy 
as it so clearly does in a craft economy. In the sections ahead, I’ll make three arguments to support this claim. These arguments roughly follow a trajectory from the conceptually narrow to broad: starting with a neurological perspective, moving to the psychological, and ending with the philosophical. 
46. The thesis of this final chapter in Part 1, therefore, is that a deep life is not just economically lucrative, but 
also a life well lived. 
47. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to. 
48. when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what’s right.” 
49. “The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to 
accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” 
50. Human beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging. 
51. Deep work is an activity well suited to generate a flow state (the phrases used by Csikszentmihalyi to describe what
 generates flow include notions of stretching your mind to its limits, concentrating, and losing yourself in an activity—all of which also describe deep work). 
52. You don’t need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work. 
53. You need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your professional life. (As argued in this rule’s 
introduction, attempting to schedule deep work in an ad hoc fashion is not 
54. an effective way to manage your limited willpower.) 
55. The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling 
56. Knuth, for example, explains his professional goal as follows: “I try to learn certain areas of computer science 
exhaustively; then I try to digest that knowledge into a form that is accessible to people who don’t have time for such study.” 
57. The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling 
58. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and 
leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically—seeking 
59. intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of 
time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches (as many academics do over the summer or while on sabbatical). 
60. people will usually respect your right to become inaccessible if these periods are well defined and well advertised,
 and outside these stretches, you’re once again easy to find. 
61. The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling 
62. An often-overlooked observation about those who use their minds to create valuable things is that they’re rarely 
haphazard in their work habits. 
63. it: Once you’ve evolved something that feels right, the impact can be significant. To work deeply is a big deal and 
should not be an activity undertaken lightly. Surrounding such efforts with a complicated (and perhaps, to the outside world, quite 
64. strange) ritual accepts this reality—providing your mind with the structure and commitment it needs to slip into the
 state of focus where you can begin to create things that matter. 
65. it’s not just the change of environment or seeking of quiet that enables more depth. The dominant force is the 
psychology of committing so seriously to the task at hand. 
66. A physicist on his way to lunch in the cafeteria was like a magnet rolling past iron filings.” 
67. collaborative form of deep work (common in academic circles) that leverages what I call the whiteboard effect. 
68. Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important 
69. “The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish.” 
70. For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify a small number of ambitious 
outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours. 
71. Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures 
72. lag measures and lead measures. Lag measures describe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve. 
73. Lead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.” 
74. Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard 
75. Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability 
76. Instead, I want to suggest a more applicable but still quite powerful heuristic: At the end of the workday, shut 
down your consideration of work issues until the next morning—no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you’ll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. If you need more time, then extend your workday, but once you shut down, your mind must be left free 
77. Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights 
78. some decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle. In other words, to actively try to work through
 these decisions will lead to a worse outcome than loading up the relevant information and then moving on to something else while letting the subconscious layers of your mind mull things over. 
79. Your conscious mind, according to this theory, is like a home computer on which you can run carefully written 
programs that return correct answers to limited problems, whereas your unconscious mind is like Google’s vast data centers, in which statistical algorithms sift through terabytes of unstructured information, teasing out surprising useful solutions to difficult questions. 
80. Reason #2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply 
81. Walking in nature provides such a mental respite, but so, too, can any number of relaxing activities so long as they
 provide similar “inherently fascinating stimuli” and freedom from directed concentration. Having a casual conversation with a friend, listening to music while making dinner, playing a game with your 
82. trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that 
you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown. 
83. Reason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important 
84. Ericsson notes that for a novice, somewhere around an hour a day of intense concentration seems to be a limit, while
 for experts this number can expand to as many as four hours—but rarely more. 
85. The implication of these results is that your capacity for deep work in a given day is limited. If you’re careful 
about your schedule (using, for example, the type of productivity strategies described in Rule #4), you should hit your daily deep work capacity during your workday. It follows, therefore, that by evening, you’re beyond the point where you can continue to effectively work deeply. Any work you do fit into the night, 
86. therefore, won’t be the type of high-value activities that really advance your career; your efforts will instead 
likely be confined to low-value shallow tasks (executed at a slow, low-energy pace). By deferring evening work, in other words, you’re not missing out on much of importance. 
87. When you’re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (to end my own ritual, I say, “Shutdown 
complete”). 
88. The first thing I do is take a final look at my e-mail 
89. mail inbox to ensure that there’s nothing requiring an urgent response before the day ends. The next thing I do is 
transfer any new tasks that are on my mind or were scribbled down earlier in the day into my official task lists. (I use Google Docs for storing my task lists, as I like the ability to access them from any computer—but the technology here isn’t really relevant.) Once I have these task lists open, I quickly skim every task in every list, and then look at the next few days on my calendar. These two actions ensure that there’s nothing urgent I’m forgetting or any important deadlines or appointments sneaking 
90. up on me. I have, at this point, reviewed everything that’s on my professional plate. To end the ritual, I use this 
information to make a rough plan for the next day. Once the plan is created, I say, “Shutdown complete,” and my work thoughts are done for the day. 
91. the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention. It tells us that if you simply stop whatever you are 
doing at five p.m. and declare, “I’m done with work until tomorrow,” you’ll likely struggle to keep your mind clear of professional issues, as the many obligations left unresolved in your mind will, as in Bluma Zeigarnik’s experiments, keep battling for your attention throughout the evening (a battle that they’ll often win). 
92. “Committing to a specific plan for a goal may therefore not only facilitate attainment of the goal but may also free
 cognitive resources for other pursuits.” 
93. Shutdown rituals can become annoying, as they add an extra ten to fifteen minutes to the end of your workday (and 
sometimes even more), but they’re necessary for reaping the rewards of systematic idleness summarized previously. From my experience, it should take a week or two before the shutdown habit sticks—that is, until your mind trusts your ritual 
94. enough to actually begin to release work-related thoughts in the evening. But once it does stick, the ritual will 
become a permanent fixture in your life—to the point that skipping the routine will fill you with a sense of unease. 
95. multiple different subfields within psychology all point toward the conclusion that regularly resting your brain 
improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done. Your average e-mail response time might suffer some, but you’ll more than make up for this with the sheer volume of truly important work produced 
96. during the day by your refreshed ability to dive deeper than your exhausted peers. 
97. Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus. 
98. “Do what Thoreau did, which is learn to have a little disconnectedness within the connected world—don’t run away.” 
99. Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times. 
100. Like Roosevelt at Harvard, attack the task with every free neuron until it gives way under your unwavering barrage 
of concentration. 
101. The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not 
mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. 
102. By forcing you to resist distraction and return your attention repeatedly to a well-defined problem, it helps 
strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles, and by forcing you to push your focus deeper and deeper on a single problem, it sharpens your concentration. 
103. Rule #3 Quit Social Media 
104. The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection: You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify
 any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it. 
105. The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your 
professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts. 
106. Identifying what matters most in your life, and then attempting to assess the impacts of various tools on these 
factors, doesn’t reduce to a simple formula—this task requires practice and experimentation. 
107. The Law of the Vital Few*: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the 
possible causes. 
108. He spent an afternoon packing everything he owned into cardboard boxes as if he was about to move. In order to 
transform what he described as a “difficult undertaking” into something less onerous, he called it a “packing party,” explaining: “Everything’s more exciting when it’s a party, right?” Once the packing was done, Nicodemus then spent the next week going through his normal routine. If he needed something that was packed, he would unpack it and put it back 
109. where it used to go. At the end of the week, he noticed that the vast majority of his stuff remained untouched in 
its boxes. So he got rid of it. 
110. mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want
 is change—not rest, except in sleep. 
111. we’ll see better results when people have a long stretch of uninterrupted time.” 
112. We spend much of our day on autopilot—not giving much thought to what we’re doing with our time. This is a 
problem. It’s difficult to prevent the trivial from creeping into every corner of your schedule if you don’t face, 
113. without flinching, your current balance between deep and shallow work, and then adopt the habit of pausing before 
action and asking, “What makes the most sense right now?” 
114. Decide in advance what you’re going to do with every minute of your workday. It’s natural, at first, to resist 
this idea, as it’s undoubtedly easier to continue to allow the twin forces of internal whim and external requests to drive your schedule. But you must overcome this distrust of structure if you want to approach your true potential as someone who creates 
115. commitment fixed-schedule productivity, as I fix the firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work 
backward to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration. I’ve practiced fixed-schedule productivity happily for more than half a decade now, and it’s been crucial to my efforts to build a productive professional life centered on deep work. 
116. default behavior when receiving an e-mail message is to not respond. 
117. Professorial E-mail Sorting: Do not reply to an e-mail message if any of the following applies: • It’s ambiguous
 or otherwise makes it hard for you to generate a reasonable response. • It’s not a question or proposal that interests you. • Nothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing really bad would 
118. happen if you didn’t. 
119. you send fewer e-mails and ignore those that aren’t easy to process—and by doing so will significantly weaken the 
grip your inbox maintains over your time and attention. 
120. “The one trait that differentiated [Gates from Allen] was focus. Allen’s mind would flit between many ideas and 
passions, but Gates was a serial obsessor.” 
121. A commitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it’s not a philosophical statement—it is instead a pragmatic 
recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that gets valuable things done. 
121. Deep work is way more powerful than most people understand. It’s a commitment to this skill that allowed Bill 
Gates to make the most of an unexpected opportunity to create a new industry, and that allowed me to double my academic productivity the same year I decided to concurrently write a book. To leave the distracted masses to join the focused few, I’m arguing, 
122. “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.”
